# Virtual Shadow Map (VSM), directional-light clipmap, Phase 1a.
#
# Architecture: a small CPU-authoritative page table (VSMPageTable.ixx) maps
# (clip level, page coord) to a slot in a single physical atlas texture.
# VSM_RenderPage is one pass per clipmap LEVEL (not per page): a single scene
# traversal, mesh-shader-only dispatch (no amplification/culling stage yet),
# with SV_ViewportArrayIndex routing each meshlet's output to all
# pages_per_level^2 pages of that level in one DispatchMesh call (Y dimension
# = page index -- see mesh_shader_vsm.hlsl). Sampling happens through
# VSM_Combine, which is fully independent from PSSM_Combine. PSSM is left
# untouched.
